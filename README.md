# String Lab's landing page
This is the code for String Lab's landing page. We use python (flask) for the backend of the application. There is an
integration with google calendars to pull the next 3 events.

It is currently running on a Heroku app with gunicorn. The initialization command is in the procfile. Here is the link
for the webapp:

Anyone is more than welcome to suggest features and improvements! Just open an issue or do a pull request and we will be
glad to take a look.
